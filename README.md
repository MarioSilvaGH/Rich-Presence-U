### About

This GUI application allows you to display **Wii U**, **Nintendo Switch** and **Nintendo 3DS** games with a custom or predefined description on your *Discord* profile. There are over 400 titles across all three platforms.

> This application does not use nor support any console modifications by default, it needs manual setup in order to show your games. Titles and icons are primarily based on *North America* releases by default, you can change this by creating your own [custom client](https://github.com/ninstar/Rich-Presence-U/wiki/English#Overrides). If you have any icons for games that have not been included yet, you can submit them through [this form](https://forms.gle/SztU5GdQEgwx45GX8) or via pull request. Documentation can be found on the **Wiki** tab.
